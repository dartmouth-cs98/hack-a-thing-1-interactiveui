# Hack-a-thing-1: interactiveUI
#### Description 
This is my exploration of React JS, following the tutorial linked here,  https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites, as well as my experimentation into learned concepts. Tutorial code has been renamed tutorial_index.js, while my additional code is titled index.js. Supplemental videos by LearnCode.academy (REACT JS TUTORIAL series) helped me further understand concepts. 

#### What I Learned 
Throughout this process, I was able to refamiliarize myself with Javascript concepts I haven't explored since high school through the application of JS React. I learned about the use of states and props to maintain components that are dynamic, as well as the handling of events and data changes over time. The tutorial and my additional work in React forced me to revisit Javascript syntax when confused, and the use of Github allowed me to quickly remember Git flow. 

#### What Didn't Work
1. GitHub
    * Prior to this assignment, I hadn't used GitHub extensively. As such, I was confused when I couldn't immediately connect. This was because I didn't add my SSH key to my account, which I resolved with the help of this guide: https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/.
2. Sublime
    * Upon starting this project, I noticed immediately that JSX syntax was recognized by Sublime. This presented an issue with the debugging and formatting of my code.
3. React States
	* When first starting to explore React without a guide, I attempted to create a simple incrementor based on onClick events. I initially did not utilize states in the implementation of this code, which led to issues with the button not working as intended or unwanted addition to my value.
